# Micro Agent UI  

A web interface for **[Micro Agent](https://github.com/BuilderIO/micro-agent)**, an AI-powered CLI tool that writes and fixes code through test-driven development. Micro Agent generates test cases, iterates on code, and ensures all tests pass — enhancing the TDD workflow.  

## Project Status  
This project is in its early stages. Currently, the UI is partially complete, but integration with the CLI tool is still in progress.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** React  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express  
- **Database:** MongoDB  

## Features (Planned & Implemented)  
✔️ User-friendly interface for interacting with Micro Agent  
✔️ Input prompts for configuration settings  
⬜ Integration with CLI agent  
⬜ Live updates on code iteration
